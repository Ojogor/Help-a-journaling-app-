Journal App with Custom Text Editor
This project is a journal application developed using React and powered by Draft.js, a powerful and customizable rich text editor framework. The primary goal of this application is to provide users with a versatile and intuitive platform for documenting their thoughts, ideas, and experiences in a digital journal format.

Features
Custom Text Editor: The application incorporates a custom text editor built using Draft.js. This editor provides users with a feature-rich and highly flexible interface for composing journal entries. Users can format text, add images, create lists, apply styles, and more, empowering them to personalize their journal entries to reflect their unique writing style.

Persistent Save: The journal app ensures that users' entries are automatically saved and persisted. The application seamlessly saves drafts as users type, eliminating the need for manual saving and ensuring that progress is always preserved. The data is stored locally using the browser's local storage API.

Entry Management: Users can create, edit, and delete journal entries. They can add a new entry with a default heading and content or modify existing entries. The application allows users to update the entry's title, mood, date, and content.

Print Functionality: The app provides a print feature that allows users to print their journal entries directly from the browser. The print functionality opens a new window with the entry's content formatted for printing.
